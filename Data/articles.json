Fernando Calabria Jr. from the Calbayog City Police Station, but \"no action\" has been done by the said court so far.\n\n \"The letter disregards the very basic principle that lawyers are free and even duty-bound to represent those accused regardless of political or ideological persuasions so that their rights are protected, due process is observed, justice is done, and that the rule of law is upheld. Lawyers therefore should not be suspected, discriminated against, faulted, red-tagged, or attacked for doing their professional duty,\" IBP national president Domingo Egon Cayosa said in a statement.\n\n \"The letter is improper, deplorable, and alarming.\"\n\n Cayosa called on authorities for a comprehensive probe on the request and \"promote state responsibility to ensure that lawyers can do their job without threats, harassment, intimidation, or retribution.\"\n\n \"As we remain vigilant, we trust that Filipino lawyers will remain courageous and steadfast sentinels of the rule of law,\" he said.\n\n The National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) also condemned the request. The NULP said the letter shows \"barefaced disregard of the PNP for human rights, particularly the right to access lawyers and legal services.\n\n \"It is an affront to the right and duty of lawyers to exercise their profession without fear as well as the administration of justice,\" the NUPL said in a statement.\n\n \"The police has no right to profile lawyers on the basis of their clients' personalities or ideologies. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, lawyers must 'not be identified with their clients or their clients' causes as a result of discharging their functions.' Nevertheless, lawyers, like other citizens, are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. The persecution of lawyers, on account of their functions as officers of the court, simply cannot be tolerated,\" it said.\n\n The union accused the PNP as the \"leading perpetrators of lawlessness and terror\" in the Philippines under the \"murderous regime\" of President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power in 2016 on a promise to eradicate crime and illegal drug trade through violent means.\n\n \"It was the police that mercilessly killed suspected drug offenders in the tens of thousands and, most recently, nine activists in Southern Tagalog -- tokhang-style -- while allegedly enforcing search warrants for loose firearms. Even the reported assassins of Calbayog City Mayor Ronald Aquino are uniformed police personnel,\" the NUPL said.\n\n The police request came days after Aquino and several others were killed. Authorities claimed it was a shootout between the mayor's men and the police, but a lawmaker, along with Aquino's son, argued it was an ambush by non-uniformed cops.\n\n \"The letter intensifies the atmosphere of fear and repression with which lawyers are trying to perform their sworn duties towards the courts, society, and their clients, regardless of the latter's political beliefs. It has no objective other than to create a virtual hitlist of lawyer targets to be 'neutralized.' Needless to state, it must be rebuffed, even condemned, by the courts,\" the NUPL said.\n\n At least 54 lawyers, judges and prosecutors have been killed during the term of Duterte, the union said, and the PNP's request to get the names of lawyers of CTG members' \"produces a chilling effect\" to legal counsels in the Philippines.\n\n \"We thus reiterate our calls for measures that will ensure that lawyers such as ourselves will be able to perform all of our professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. We also demand that the PNP immediately desist from harassing our colleagues in the legal profession -- lawyers for \"CTG personalities\" or not,\" the NUPL said.\n\n According to Cayosa, the IBP was assured by top PNP officials that there was no directive to Calabria to procure the names of legal counsels.\n\n FROM THE ARCHIVES\n\n"}, {"title": "Vaccination program, baka abutin ng hanggang 2033 dahil sa bagal ayon kay Senator Lacson", "datetime": "Mar 12 11:16 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "Bakas ng droga, kapabayaan nakita sa pagkamatay ni Christine Dacera: NBI", "datetime": "Mar 12 11:01 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": "MAYNILA - May nakitang bakas ng droga at kapabayaan sa pagkamatay ni Christine Dacera, nang makakita ng ebidensiyang may droga sa kuwarto na tinuluyan ng flight attendant at ng kaniyang mga kaibigan noong New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n Ito ang lumabas sa isinagawang imbestigasyon ng National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) sa hiling na parallel probe ng pamilya ng flight attendant sa kaso.\n\n Ayon sa NBI Death Investigation Division Agent on Case na si Atty. Zulikha Conales Degamo, may nakitang bakas ng metamphetamine o fluoromethampethamine, o party drugs nang suriin ang bakas ng lugar kung saan sumuka si Dacera, 23, bago siya namatay.\n\n Pinagbasehan din ng NBI ang mga naging salaysay ng mga nakasama nina Dacera sa katabing kuwarto na nakasama pa nina Dacera na mag-party sa City Garden Hotel sa Makati.\n\n Nadiskubre rin na dati nang uminom ng maintenance drugs si Dacera para sa kondisyon niya sa puso.\n\n Bagama\u2019t aneurysm ang naging cause of death, ayon sa mga eksperto ng NBI, posibleng nagpalala sa kaniyang kondisyon ang paggamit ng ilegal na droga.\n\n \"According to our experts na kapag ikaw ay gumamit ng drugs ay tataas ang iyong BP (blood pressure). So magra-rapid ang iyong heartbeat at tataas ang iyong BP, which will ultimately result [in] the rupture of the aneurysm,\" ani Degamo, bagama't hindi tahasang sinabi ng NBI na gumamit ng droga si Dacera.\n\n Disyembre 31 nang mag-book ng hotel room sa City Garden Hotel si Dacera kasama ang kaniyang mga kaibigan para salubungin ang Bagong Taon. Sa Room 2209 ginawa ng magkakaibgan ang pagsalubong, at may mga nakasama rin umano silang mag-party sa katabing kuwarto na Room 2207.\n\n Pagsapit ng madaling araw ay nakaramdam ng pananakit ng ulo si Dacera at kalauna'y nawalan ng malay. Idineklarang patay si Dacera nang dalhin sa ospital.\n\n Lumabas sa imbestigasyon ng PNP na natural causes ang ikinamatay at walang homicide sa nangyari, bagay na tinutulan ng pamilyang Dacera.\n\n Taliwas ang investigation findings ng NBI sa unang pahayag ng mga kaibigan ni Dacera na nagsabing wala namang gumamit sa kanila ng droga. Dahilan ito para magsampa rin ang tanggapan ng obstruction of justice laban sa 8 kaibigan ni Dacera na kasama nito sa kuwarto.\n\n Kasama sa mga sinampahan ng kasong obstruction of justice sina: Mark Rosales, Rommel Galido, John Dela Serna, Gregorio De Guzman, Jezreel Rapinan, Alain Chen, Reymay English, at Darwin Macalla.\n\n Kinasuhan naman si Rosales at Garrido dahil sa pamimigay ng droga. May hiwalay namang kaso si Rosales dahil sa paggamit ng droga.\n\n Pinakakasuhan naman ang apat sa mga kaibigan ni Dacera ng reckless imprudence dahil ilang oras na ang lumipas bago nila ito binigyan ng first aid.\n\n \"Dahil sa kakaunting panahon na kasama ni Tin ang occupants ng Room 2207 ay nakita nila na humihingal at nahihirapan itong huminga, nagsabi pa siyang numb ang kaniyang katawan, masakit ang kaniyang ulo. And yet 'yung occupants ng room 2209 who were with her for such a long time failed to observe the littlest of these details,\" ani Deramo.\n\n Pinakakasuhan naman ng perjury sina Galido, Dela Serna, at De Leon ng perjury, at obstruction of justice si Neptali Maroto kaugnay sa mga binawing salaysay sa pulis, na ayon sa NBI ay walang basehan.\n\n Batay sa naging imbestigasyon, hindi napatunayang ni-rape si Dacera, ayon kay NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin, dahil wala umano itong mga abrasion o gasgas na nakita sa kaniyang ari at may ihi na nakuha sa kaniyang pantog - taliwas sa naging unang police report na ni-rape ang dalaga.\n\n Masaya naman ang mga abogado ng pamilyang Dacera sa resulta ng imbestigasyon.\n\n \"Redemption para sa amin ito. In spite of the opinion sa social media, 'yung negative na natanggap ng family, ito po samin ay \u2018yung bunga ng paghihirap ng NBI, sa pakikipagtulungan nila sa mga ahensiya,\" ani Jose Ledda III, abogado ng pamilya.\n\n Ayon sa NBI, hindi nagbigay ng salaysay ang 9 na kaibigan ni Dacera kahit ilang beses silang inimbita, pero maaari pa rin silang magpaliwanag sa piskal.\n\n Sinubukan din ng ABS-CBN News na kuhanin ang panig ng ilan sa mga kinasuhan pero tumanggi muna sila habang hinihintay nila ang kopya ng isinampang kaso ng NBI.\n\n \u2014 Ulat ni Niko Baua, ABS-CBN News\n\n"}, {"title": "Pacquiao nagpatutsada sa kapartido: Unahin ang pandemya bago politika", "datetime": "Mar 12 09:51 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "PH embassy sa US nanawagan na paigtingin ang aksiyon vs Asian hate crimes", "datetime": "Mar 12 09:41 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "Checking for symptoms", "datetime": "Mar 12 09:32 PM", "author": "Jire Carreon, ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "Police checkpoints ipatutupad sa 'COVID-19 hotspots' sa Kamaynilaan", "datetime": "Mar 12 09:30 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "ALAMIN: Kuwento ng magpinsang Dumagat na pinaslang noong 'Bloody Sunday'", "datetime": "Mar 12 08:59 PM", "author": "Mike Navallo, ABS-CBN News", "article": "MAYNILA \u2014 Pinuntahan ng Commission on Human Rights (CHR) nitong Biyernes ang pinangyarihan ng pagpatay sa 2 Dumagat tribe members sa Tanay, Rizal noong Linggo, ang tinaguriang \"Bloody Sunday\" ng mga aktibista.\n\n Higit 2 oras ang ibiniyahe at higit 30 minuto pa ang nilakad ng mga kinatawan ng CHR para marating ang Sitio Mina, Barangay Sta.

That vomitous matter has presence of 4 flouromethamphetamine and methamphetamine so two types of illegal drugs were found.)\n\n Deramo also added that Dacera herself allegedly stayed at room 2207, the neighboring room, not wanting to be at room 2209 because there was an \u201corgy\u201d happening in the room and that they were high on drugs.\n\n \"When she (Tin) went to room 2207 she alleged na ayaw na niya doon kasi number one nag-o-orgy ang mga ito and number 2, shuas.

Apparently he's not a user but allegedly, Rommel insisted, went to a friend and asked for such party drugs. But then said \"sorry there's no more,\" so no more, so that's corroboration.)\n\n There was also \"insinuation\" that Dacera herself took drugs, she added, but the NBI did not categorically say she did.\n\n \"JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated na Tin also used, na gumamit, ang sabi niya 'Mali kasi 'yon ang ecstasy at alcohol kasi 'yung heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy,\" she said, adding that Dacera had allegedly disclosed to Garrido that her drink was spiked by Mark Rosales.\n\n (JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated that Tin also used, he said \"it's wrong, ecstasy and alcohol affects the heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy.)\n\n Findings by the NBI contradict statements by Dacera\u2019s companions that there was no drug use at the party.\n\n However, the \"interplay between drugs and alcohol\" at the incident, according to Deramo, was still \"not very clear.\"\n\n The reautopsy of Dacera\u2019s body showed that her cause of death was \u201cmicroscopic evidence of peri-aortic hemorrhages and aortic wall distruption.\u201d\n\n The toxicology report also showed that Dacera\u2019s body had traces of Diltiazem, a prescription drug for hypertension.

Her friends said they tried to revive her and brought her to the Makati Medical Center, where she was later declared dead.\n\n Dacera and her friends had booked Room 2209 at City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City to ring in the New Year. According to CCTV footage, they went back and forth to Room 2207 after being introduced to guests there.\n\n The PNP, in a medico-legal report, said Dacera died of natural causes, ruling out that her death on New Year\u2019s day was a crime after initially suspecting rape and homicide against her companions.\n\n RELATED VIDEO:\n\n"}, {"title": "TIPS: Paano labanan ang 'pandemic fatigue' habang isang taon nang naka-lockdown", "datetime": "Mar 12 06:03 PM", "author": "Josiah Antonio, ABS-CBN News", "article": "MAYNILA \u2014 Tila mabilis makaranas ng pagod at pagkalugmok ang mga Pilipino, isang taon na makalipas isailalim kalakhang Maynila at ibang probinsiya sa iba't-ibang level ng quarantine.\n\n Sa ilalim ng lockdown, marami ang nakulong sa kanilang mga tahanan at kasamang naiuwi na rin ang mga pang-araw-araw na gawain tulad ng trabaho o pag-aaral.

Hindi 'yun sanctioned as acting president ng partido,\" he said.\n\n (I did not know about it. It was not sanctioned [by me] as acting party president.)\n\n The said resolution, dated March 8, was signed mostly by mayors and lawmakers, Melvin Matibag, PDP-Laban deputy party secretary general, earlier told ABS-CBN News.\n\n Among the signatories were MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos, Mandaluyong Mayor Carmelita Abalos, Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas, and Para\u00f1aque City Mayor Edwin Olivares.\n\n Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III said differences among party members on whether or not Duterte should run as vice president should not be considered as infighting.\n\n \"'Wag ninyo i-characterize as infighting,\" Pimentel said.\n\n (Do not characterize it as infighting.)\n\n \"Sen.

Manny Pacquiao is reminding the members to focus on helping. The time for politics will come. Let's wait for that time to come.)\n\n Pacquiao on Friday issued a \"warning\" against Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, the party vice-chair, who he said was sowing division within the group.\n\n The senator made the statement as he asked members to refrain from talking about the upcoming elections as the country continued to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n Cusi was allegedly among PDP-Laban members behind the resolution urging Duterte to run for vice president.\n\n On the same day the resolution was released, Duterte himself talked politics, saying his long-time ally Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go was aspiring to become president. Go denied this in a statement but said he might change his mind if the current chief executive would agree to run for vice president.\n\n DISCIPLINARY ACTION\n\n Pacquiao belied allegations that several party members were planning to break away from the ruling party, saying more politicians want to join PDP-Laban.\n\n \"Marami pang gusto mag oath, sumama sa partido. Sabi ko 'wag muna dahil pandemic pa, bawal pa,\" he said.\n\n (Many want to take their oath, join the party. I said not yet because the pandemic is still going.)\n\n When asked about conflicting statements being released by several PDP-Laban members, Pacquiao said: \"Inaayos na natin 'yung mga lumalabas na isyu.\"\n\n (We are already fixing the issues.)\n\n \"Aaksyunan namin 'yang mga ganiyan na hindi sumusunod sa partido,\" said Pacquiao, who boxing promoter Bob Arum last year said might also seek the presidency.\n\n (We will act on those who refuse to toe the party line.)\n\n Instead of disclosing specific sanctions against erring members, Pacquiao released a memo calling for unity within the party and directing all PDP-Laban members to avoid discussing politics at this time as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.\n\n \"I have the responsibility to enforce rules, promote cooperation, insist on civility and respect, and most of all, to remind you that we are one team,\" his memo read.\n\n \"Before we can truly solve the problems of the country, we must first focus on ourselves and our beloved party.\"\n\n This is not the first time PDP-Laban seemed divided months before an election.\n\n In 2018, a group from Mindanao claiming to be party members on Wednesday held an event at the Quezon Memorial Circle criticizing then PDP-Laban Secretary General Pantaleon Alvarez.\n\n The group, led by PDP-Laban national council chair Rogelio Garcia, slammed Alvarez for leading the mass-oath taking of new party members without complying with the application process.\n\n Old party members were not invited to PDP-Laban's 36th anniversary celebration at a hotel in Makati City, Garcia added.\n\n The group issued a resolution declaring Alvarez persona non grata from the party, but then-party president Pimentel denied that PDP-Laban had made such a declaration.\n\n In 2019, Alvarez accused the ruling party of keeping him in the dark about its decision to back Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco's bid for the House Speakership, which he was also vying for.\n\n Alvarez was hoping to make a comeback as Speaker after he was ousted from the post in 2018 in a coup maneuvered by the President's daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte.

Do not eat what you said.)\n\n Earlier this week, several PDP-Laban members signed a resolution pushing for Duterte to run for Vice President in 2022, citing the need for the \"continuity of the Government\u2019s 10-point Socioeconomic Agenda.\"\n\n On the same day, Duterte said his long-time ally Sen. Bong Go wants to become President. The latter said the president was just joking, but added he would only run if Duterte seeks the vice presidency.\n\n Pacquiao said the resolution is not official.\n\n \"Hindi legitimate 'yung resolution na ginawa. Nalaman ko lang 'yun dahil sinabi sa'kin ng tao ko,\" he said.\n\n (The resolution is illegitimate. I only knew about it because one of my staff told me.)\n\n PDP-Laban members who would continuously defy the order to refrain from talking about the 2022 national elections at this time would be \"dealt with,\" Pacquiao said.\n\n \"Karapatan ko na aksyunan ano man ang ginagawa ng lahat ng miyembro ng partido. Karapatan kong ituwid kung ano man ang mali,\" he said.\n\n (It is my right to sanction the activities of party members. It is my right to correct any mistake.)\n\n \"Napakaaga pa. Ang pag-usapan natin tulong dahil maraming tao ang magugutom,\" he said.\n\n (It is still too early. We should talk about helping others because a lot of people would go hungry.)\n\n CUSI SAYS NOT BEHIND DUTERTE-FOR-VP CALL\n\n Cusi, meanwhile, belied allegations he was sowing division within the party, saying the matter of Duterte possibly running as vice president next year was brought up by participants of the party's consultative assemblies in Manila, Cebu and Davao.\n\n \"This is the collective sentiment of the leaders on the ground. It did not come from me,\" Cusi said in a statement released hours after Pacquiao's press conference.\n\n \"I am just one member and the decision should be a collective action of the whole. This should be the guiding principle too in the choice of our party officers,\" he said.\n\n Pacquiao became PDP-Laban president in December 2020, while House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco was installed as acting executive vice president.\n\n This is the second time PDP-Laban was embroiled in allegations of infighting months before an election.\n\n In 2018, a group from Mindanao claiming to be party members held an event at the Quezon Memorial Circle criticizing then PDP-Laban Secretary General Pantaleon Alvarez.\n\n RELATED VIDEO\n\n"}, {"title": "Plebisito para sa paghahati sa Palawan, kasado na", "datetime": "Mar 12 02:14 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": "Polling booths-in-waiting. #PalawanPleb pic.twitter.com/WJUR8TKnH1\n\n \n\n MAYNILA - Handang-handa na ang Commission on Elections (Comelec) sa pagsasagawa ng plebisito sa Marso 13 para sa panukalang paghahati sa Palawan sa tatlong probinsiya.\n\n \u201cAll systems go na po tayo.

Pag na-accomplish na nila 'yun, pwede silang magtungo doon sa tinatawag nating voters assistance desk,\u201d sabi ni Jimenez.\n\n Dito, tutulungan sila ng mga volunteers para malaman kung saang presinto at anong kuwarto sila naka-assign sa mismong botohan. Pagpunta sa polling place, kukuha ng balota pero kailangang dumaan muna sa health screening.\n\n \u201cMagkakaroon ng temperature check at titingnan kung sila ay walang sintomas ng COVID-19.

Rosales is also facing a separate charge for allegedly introducing the party drugs to his companions.\n\n \"There was presence of dangerous drugs, fluoromethamphetamine 'yung suka doon sa room 2209. We have testimonial pieces of evidence and then itong forensic report ng SOCO, and then mayroon din itong (there is this) testimony galing kay (from) Jake Esperon that he was offered illegal drugs and it was also testified that Mark showed him powdered drugs. He pulled the powdered drugs from his socks,\" NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said at the briefing.\n\n The NBI also filed falsification of public documents charges against Southern Police District Medico Legal Officer Police Maj. Michael Sarmiento, who conducted the autopsy on Dacera.\n\n Dacera was found unconscious and without a pulse in a bathtub at the Makati hotel around 12:30 p.m. on January 1 after a night of partying. Her friends said they tried to revive her and brought her to the Makati Medical Center, where she was later declared dead.\n\n Dacera and her friends had booked Room 2209 at City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City to ring in the New Year. According to CCTV footage, they went back and forth to Room 2207 after being introduced to guests there.\n\n The PNP, in a medico-legal report, said Dacera died of natural causes, ruling out that her death on New Year\u2019s day was a crime after initially suspecting rape and homicide against her companions. This was later on refuted by her family.\n\n The NBI also said Dacera\u2019s friends did not give their statements despite multiple attempts for a request.\n\n However, they can still explain their side with the fiscal.\n\n ABS-CBN News also tried to seek the side of those facing charges, but they declined to give a statement pending the copy of the case filed by the NBI. \u2014 reports from Niko Baua and Angela Coloma, ABS-CBN News\n\n"}, {"title": "Malakihang operasyon laban sa COVID-19 protocol violators, isinagawa sa QC", "datetime": "Mar 12 12:46 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": ""}, {"title": "Sinas 'in high spirits' despite COVID-19 diagnosis\u2014 PNP spox", "datetime": "Mar 12 12:34 PM", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "article": "MANILA\u2014 Philippine National Police chief Gen.
